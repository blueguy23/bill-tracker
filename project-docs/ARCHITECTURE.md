# Architecture

## Overview

Folio is a single Next.js 15 (App Router) application that serves both the UI and the API from one process. It is deployed as a Docker container and connects to a MongoDB database (local or Atlas).

        └── Lib               (src/lib/)        ← pure utilities

External services (all optional):
  SimpleFIN bridge  ← bank account / transaction sync
  Trove API         ← transaction categorization enrichment
  Discord           ← bill-due notifications
  Upstash Redis     ← login rate limiting
```

## Key Layers

### Pages (`src/app/`)
Server components that call adapters directly via `getDb()`. Never use internal `fetch()` from server components — the auth middleware would block it and it adds latency.

### API Routes (`src/app/api/v1/`)
Thin route handlers: parse the request, call a handler, return JSON. All routes require a valid NextAuth session (enforced by `src/middleware.ts`). The `/api/v1/health` endpoint is public.

### Handlers (`src/handlers/`)
Business logic — orchestrate multiple adapters, apply rules, call external services. Handlers do not import `next/server` or touch HTTP concerns.

### Adapters (`src/adapters/`)
All MongoDB access goes through StrictDB via the shared singleton in `src/adapters/db.ts`. Never import `mongodb` directly in application code.

### Auth (`src/auth.ts`, `src/middleware.ts`)
NextAuth v5 credentials provider. Middleware guards every route except NextAuth internals, static assets, and the health endpoint. Demo mode (`user.name === 'Demo'`) is read-only.

## Data Flow — Bank Sync

```
Cron (every 2h) or manual trigger
  → POST /api/v1/sync
  → src/handlers/sync.ts
  → SimpleFINClient.fetchAccounts()     (SimpleFIN bridge)
  → upsertAccount() × N                 (MongoDB: accounts)
  → upsertTransaction() × N             (MongoDB: transactions)
    └── categorize()                    (keyword rules)
    └── troveEnrich() (async)           (Trove API → category override)
  → updateSyncLog()                     (MongoDB: syncLog)
```

## Data Flow — Bill Notifications

```
Cron (daily) or manual trigger
  → src/handlers/notificationDigest.ts
  → listBillsDueSoon()
  → Discord webhook
```

## Data Flow — Goals Sync

```
Bank sync (daily/manual/historical)
  → src/handlers/sync.ts (post-sync hook)
  → src/handlers/goalSync.ts
  → listLinkedGoals()               (goals with linkedAccountId)
  → match account balance from latest sync
  → updateGoalSavedAmount()         (MongoDB: goals)
```

## Collections (MongoDB)

| Collection | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `accounts` | Bank account records from SimpleFIN |
| `transactions` | Individual transactions |
| `bills` | Recurring bill definitions |
| `payments` | Payment history records |
| `budgets` | Monthly budget limits by category |
| `syncLog` | Daily sync metadata and quota tracking |
| `accountMeta` | Credit account settings (limit, utilization target) |
| `goals` | Savings goals with optional linked-account auto-sync |
| `categoryRules` | User-defined keyword → category rules |
| `notificationLogs` | Sent notification history |
| `_migrations` | Applied DB migration tracking |

## Security Headers

Set in `next.config.ts`:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (production only)

## SimpleFIN Field Utilization

### Tier 1 — Captured (implemented)

| Field | Object | What it powers |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| `cost-basis` | Holding | Unrealized gain/loss per holding and total portfolio return in PortfolioWidget |
| `quantity` | Holding | Per-holding share count displayed in PortfolioWidget |
| `purchased-at` | Holding | Stored as `purchasedAt` on Holding for future holding-period tracking |
| `extra.category` | Transaction | Extracted as `bridgeCategory` — used as last-resort fallback in categorization engine (after user rules, keyword rules, and Trove) |

### Tier 2 — Backlog (typed but not yet surfaced)

| Field | Object | Potential use |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| `conn_id` | Account | Read ad-hoc in client.ts for org-name propagation; should be stored as a first-class field to enable institution grouping, connection health monitoring, and per-connection error reporting |
| `org.sfin-url` | Organization | Could link to institution's SimpleFIN server for connection diagnostics |
| `account.extra` | Account | Stored in MongoDB but never queried — contains `account-open-date` (credit age calculation) and other institution-specific metadata |
| `transaction.extra` | Transaction | Stored but only `pending` and `category` are extracted — may contain institution-specific fields worth surfacing |

### Tier 3 — Not yet captured (spec fields missing from types)

| Field | Object | Potential use |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| `Connection` object | Top-level (AccountSet) | Full connection metadata (name, org_id, org_url, sfin_url) — enables institution grouping, connection status page, favicon/logo fetching via `org_url` |
| `org_id` | Connection | Stable institution ID for grouping accounts across multiple connections |
| `org_url` | Connection | Institution domain — auto-populate bill URLs, fetch favicons for account display |
| `errlist` | AccountSet | Replaces deprecated `errors` array with richer per-connection error structure |
